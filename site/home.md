A dense, definition-driven synthesis of mind, based on Joscha Bach’s public work.

This project turns public talks, interviews, and essays into a source-grounded model of mind with explicit citations and timecodes. The goal is reproducibility at the level of meaning: given the cited sources and the project instructions, independent writers (human or model) should converge on the same core content.

If you are here to read, start at the [Reader](https://the-mind.xyz/reader/), then use the [Blog](https://the-mind.xyz/blog/) for shorter topic-focused entries. The knowledge base at [Glossary](https://the-mind.xyz/glossary/), [Claims](https://the-mind.xyz/claims/), [Sources](https://the-mind.xyz/sources/), and [Lineage](https://the-mind.xyz/lineage/) provides definitions, claims, and provenance.

If you are here to collaborate, use the repository at [github.com/p0s/the-mind](https://github.com/p0s/the-mind). The repo contains the manuscript, blog inputs, source index, and build scripts used to regenerate the site and exports, so contribution can stay source-first and auditable.

Build locally with `npm ci` and `python3 scripts/build_all.py`.
