> Man is a machine.

A dense, definition-driven synthesis of mind, based on Joscha Bach’s public work.

> “Why should we build AI?” in first place, then, "How can we build AI? How is it possible at all that AI can succeed in its goal?". Then “When is it going to happen?”, if ever. "What are the necessary ingredients?", what do we need to put together to get AI to work? And: “Where should you start?”

This project turns public talks, interviews, and essays into a source-grounded model of mind with explicit citations and timecodes. The goal is reproducibility at the level of meaning: given the cited sources and the project instructions, independent writers (human or model) should converge on the same core content.

If you are here to read, you can start with either the [Reader](https://the-mind.xyz/reader/) or the [Blog](https://the-mind.xyz/blog/). The knowledge base at [Glossary](https://the-mind.xyz/glossary/), [Claims](https://the-mind.xyz/claims/), [Sources](https://the-mind.xyz/sources/), and [Lineage](https://the-mind.xyz/lineage/) provides definitions, claims, and provenance.

If you are here to collaborate, use the repository at [github.com/p0s/the-mind](https://github.com/p0s/the-mind). The repo contains the manuscript, blog inputs, source index, and build scripts used to regenerate the site and exports, so contribution can stay source-first and auditable.

Build locally with `npm ci` and `python3 scripts/build_all.py`.
