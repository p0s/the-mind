# Book Structure (Candidates)

Goal: a dense, definition-driven, non-mathematical exposition of Bach's framework, with minimal drift.

## Candidate A: Engineering Stack (recommended)

Arc: build the minimum "mind as an engineered control system" stack first, then layer valence, self, consciousness, and multi-agent extensions.

Pros:
- Clean dependency order: each chapter defines primitives used later.
- Matches how Bach often explains: from models/control/learning to self and consciousness.
- Keeps phenomenology/mechanism/function triangulation stable across the manuscript.

Cons:
- Less immediately "mysterious": the hard problem comes later (by design).

Proposed parts:
- Part I: Models, agents, control, learning
- Part II: Valence, motivation, emotion
- Part III: Self-modeling, attention, consciousness
- Part IV: Social minds, language, culture, implications for AI

## Candidate B: Inside-Out (phenomenology first)

Arc: start from what consciousness feels like (now, self, presence), then reconstruct the machinery that could produce it.

Pros:
- Strong hook; speaks to reader curiosity.
- Allows the "conductor / orchestra" intuition early.

Cons:
- High drift risk: definitions are introduced before the model is stable.
- Tends to collapse phenomenology into mechanism by accident unless heavily policed.

## Candidate C: Problem-Driven (a sequence of puzzles)

Arc: each chapter begins with a confusion ("meaning", "free will", "hard problem", "self"), and the framework is introduced as a tool to dissolve it.

Pros:
- Extremely engaging if executed well.
- Natural place for "where people get confused" sections.

Cons:
- Hard to keep an explicit dependency spine; readers may build a fragmented model.
- Requires more editorial scaffolding than we want at this register.

## Decision

Pick Candidate A.

Rationale:
- It is the most self-correcting under scale (70k+ words) because it stabilizes primitives early.
- It still allows strong openings per chapter (puzzle-first), without committing the entire book to a puzzle-driven macro-structure.
