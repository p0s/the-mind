## One-paragraph summary
Long-form interview spanning consciousness, perception-as-modeling, and AI: consciousness is framed as a stabilizing control function (keeping the “observer” and its “screen” coherent) that yields a bubble of “nowness” in which experience is consistent. Discusses the machine-consciousness question in terms of internal organization (phenomenology vs functionality), and suggests consciousness may be “binary” in the sense of igniting once sufficient representational structure exists (while lucidity admits degrees).

## Key segments (timecodes)
- [00:00:04-00:00:35] Consciousness stabilizes the observer/screen; coherence as a precondition for perception; “bubble of nowness”; “binary” framing + degrees of lucidity.
- [01:22:00-01:23:00] Phenomenology vs functionality framing (multi-speaker; verify speaker before anchoring heavily).
- [01:27:34-01:28:20] Consciousness as a binary property that “ignites”; uncertainty about thresholds / moving parts; links to representational complexity.

## Terms to add to glossary
None (no new stable term candidates).
