## One-paragraph summary
Short talk on consciousness as a coherence-maintaining, self-organizing control process: phenomenology is framed as a side-effect of the system needing to establish and maintain a stable “screen” for coherent perception. Argues this points to a testable machine-consciousness hypothesis (recreate self-organization conditions in machines) and proposes treating “tests for consciousness” as modular: define phenomenology and functionality, describe the implementation/search space, and specify success criteria rather than relying on a single monolithic metric.

## Key segments (timecodes)
- [00:00:30-00:01:09] Consciousness as coherence-maintaining self-organization; phenomenology as side-effect; “screen” stabilization; machine-consciousness as recreating self-organization conditions.
- [00:01:38-00:02:31] “Consciousness testing” as modular: define phenomenology, define functionality, describe implementation/search space, specify success criteria / valid demonstrations.
- [00:16:04-00:16:55] Representation as dynamic (represent change); identity as a special case; oscillatory representation sketch / “request confirmation networks”.

## Terms to add to glossary
