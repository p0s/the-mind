## One-paragraph summary
Long-form interview on the “world as model” framing: the experienced world is treated as a generated, interpretive model (a “dream” produced by the brain) rather than direct access to physics. Consciousness is framed as a coherence-making process that allows a collection of interacting parts to behave as a unified agent; the self is treated as a self-model (a representational tool for coordination), not an extra entity behind experience.

## Key segments (timecodes)
- [00:00:08-00:00:12] The experienced world as a generated “dream”/model; consciousness framed as a dream state.
- [00:30:08-00:30:55] Self as a self-model for coherent coordination; consciousness as coherence-making; experience as interacting with representation.
