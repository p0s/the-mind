# What is consciousness?

Consciousness is the fact that experience shows up at all: there is something it is like to be you, right now. You are confronted with a present, and the world appears from a point of view. <!-- src: yt_xthJ1R9Ifc0 @ 00:08:46 -->

The puzzle is connecting that familiar phenomenology to mechanism: why should any physical process feel like anything from the inside? <!-- src: yt_CcQMYNi9a2w @ 01:58:03 -->

On this view, consciousness is not a mysterious extra substance or “spark”. It is an architectural feature: a functional organization that stabilizes a coherent point of view. <!-- src: yt_CcQMYNi9a2w @ 01:58:03 -->

## A working definition

We will use **consciousness** to mean: a control-relevant organization that stabilizes and coordinates mental contents into a coherent point of view. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:16:38 -->

## Triangulation: three perspectives that should not be collapsed

A practical discipline is to keep three perspectives distinct when explaining consciousness: phenomenology (what it is like), mechanism (what is implemented), and function (what it does for the agent). <!-- src: yt_xthJ1R9Ifc0 @ 00:08:46 -->

## Function: coherence control (the “conductor” role)

Functionally, consciousness is framed as the process that makes disagreements between subsystems legible and resolvable at the level of the whole agent. The result is a coherent controller rather than a bundle of competing local policies. <!-- src: yt_CcQMYNi9a2w @ 01:58:03 -->

## Mechanism: workspace-like integration + an observer model

Mechanistically, one implementation route is workspace-like integration: selected content becomes globally available for coordination across otherwise specialized subsystems. The key claim is not “a place in the brain”, but a role that enables broadcast, comparison, and reconciliation. <!-- src: yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:41:09 -->

In this framing, the system maintains and stabilizes an observer reference frame as part of the loop: it is not a metaphysical entity, but a model component that makes the integration process stable and reportable. <!-- src: yt_UkAOHrbcnAs @ 00:32:15 -->

## Phenomenology: “nowness” as stabilization-from-the-inside

Phenomenologically, “nowness” is treated as how the stabilization loop appears from the inside: a coherence bubble in which the model’s active contents are synchronized tightly enough to be experienced as present. Second-order perception (“perception of perception”) is one handle for this: the model represents not only contents, but the fact that contents are being represented, which stabilizes the observer variable. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:30:34 -->

## Why there is no easy test

This framing implies there is no Turing-test-style shortcut: performance alone does not tell you whether the system implements the stabilizing observer organization. Consciousness is treated as a hypothesis about internal organization, not a behavior score. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:20:01 -->
