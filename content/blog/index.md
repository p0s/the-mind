# Blog

Not affiliated with or endorsed by Joscha Bach.

The blog is the short-form companion to the book.

Goal: write shorter, topic-focused posts (one question per post) that clarify the framework and common confusions, with citations that link back to the original sources (URLs + timecodes).

The book (Reader) is the full, definition-first walkthrough. The blog is the “zoomed-in” layer: key questions, crisp definitions, and implications.

Most posts start from phenomenology (what it is like), then connect it to function + mechanism.
