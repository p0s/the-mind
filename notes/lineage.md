# Lineage / shoulders-of-giants map

This page collects people, traditions, and canonical works that are invoked in the cited sources as intellectual lineage for the framework used in this project.

It is intentionally incomplete and will grow as additional sources are processed.

## Keystone lineage (frequently used as framing)

**Aristotle** — offered as an early non-dualist framing: the psyche as an organizing principle of living matter rather than a separable substance. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:04:07 -->

**Leibniz** — invoked as a proto-computationalist: discourse can, in principle, be formalized and evaluated mechanically. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:04:41 -->

**La Mettrie** — used to dissolve the “gears and cogs” straw man: humans can be abstract machines (causal organizations), not literal clockwork. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:05:14 -->

**Wittgenstein** — used as a pointer to a methodological problem: natural language is too ambiguous for reliable truth-tracking; we need precision closer to a modeling/programming language. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:05:37 -->

**Norbert Wiener (cybernetics)** — invoked as the control-centric bridge: minds can be described as feedback systems. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:06:57 -->

**John von Neumann (computer architecture)** — invoked as the substrate for building arbitrary causal structures at scale. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:07:04 -->

**Alan Turing** — invoked via the Turing test as a pragmatic test for intelligence; used to contrast performance-tests with consciousness-as-organization. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:20:01 -->

**Minsky / McCarthy (founding AI)** — invoked as the start of AI as an explicitly philosophical project: build minds to understand minds. <!-- src: yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:03:18 -->

## Computation, information, and formal limits

**Kurt Gödel** — invoked in the context of undecidability/limits of formal systems. <!-- src: ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:14:08 -->

**Alan Turing / Alonzo Church** — invoked as a boundary condition for what is computable/constructive in realizable systems (Church–Turing). <!-- src: ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:14:45 -->

**Claude Shannon** — invoked as the canonical notion of information (and contrasted with “meaningful information”). <!-- src: ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:52:10 -->

## Philosophy of mind (computational functionalism lineage)

**Daniel Dennett** — invoked as a major functionalist philosopher of mind (including discussion of “zombies” and why purely behavioral framings can still miss internal organization). <!-- src: ccc_38c3_self_models_of_loving_grace @ 00:27:45 -->

## Development / adult growth (agency and self-model)

**Robert Kegan** — invoked for an adult-development lens: growth as making formerly automatic processes explicit (subject → object). <!-- src: ccc_32c3_7483_computational_meta_psychology @ 00:50:04 -->

## Candidates to add (needs anchors)

As we process sources, add entries here the first time they are noticed, then later move them into the sections above once they have timecoded anchors and a short explanation of the role they play.
