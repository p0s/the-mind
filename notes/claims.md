  - Often described as a conductor role.

## CLM-0008: Consciousness is temporally anchored to the present and can be described as a second-order perception (perception of perception).
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:34:08
  - yt_MxYMW1RqdgQ @ 00:31:19
- Notes:
  - Connect to observer construction.

## CLM-0009: There is no straightforward behavioral test for consciousness; it requires interpretation of internal organization rather than performance alone.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:20:01
- Notes:
  - Contrast with the Turing test.

## CLM-0010: Intelligence and consciousness are not identical; consciousness is a particular organization of intelligence.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:20:39
- Notes:
  - Useful disambiguation in AI contexts.

## CLM-0011: In biological systems, consciousness likely appears early as a learning scaffold that stabilizes self-organization.
- Status: verified

- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:18:17
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:27:38
  - ccc_38c3_self_models_of_loving_grace @ 00:10:34
- Notes:
  - Hypothesis-level claim.

## CLM-0012: Machine consciousness is a hypothesis about reproducing self-organization conditions, not about current task performance.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:32:23
- Notes:
  - Separate biological and machine hypotheses.

## CLM-0013: Social cognition and language extend individual models into multi-agent coordination systems.

  - yt_OheY9DIUie4 @ 00:38:50
- Notes:
  - Treat as emergent control layers.

## CLM-0015: Alignment is best framed as value learning plus governance, not just optimization of a fixed utility.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 01:29:16
  - yt_uc112kET-i0 @ 00:49:42
- Notes:
  - Downstream implication, not core of the mind model.

## CLM-0016: Attention is resource allocation and selection; it is distinct from consciousness though often correlated.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:10:33
  - ccc_37c3_12167_synthetic_sentience @ 00:12:04
- Notes:
  - Prevents common conflation.

## CLM-0017: Mechanism, function, and phenomenology must be kept distinct to avoid category errors.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: high
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:20:01
  - yt_9LtKJ2k8UyM @ 00:02:05
  - yt_y0txHUVZF5I @ 01:22:15
- Notes:
  - Central methodological rule.

## CLM-0018: The explanatory gap arises when mechanism is expected to directly yield phenomenology without a functional bridge.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:01:37
- Notes:
  - Needs careful wording to avoid overclaim.

## CLM-0019: A world-model is a constructed representation optimized for control, not a literal copy of the world.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_UkAOHrbcnAs @ 00:24:59
  - ccc_37c3_12167_synthetic_sentience @ 00:18:19
- Notes:
  - Essential for model-territory distinction.

## CLM-0020: The agent is an abstraction over the organism; organisms implement agents but are not identical to them as models.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_uc112kET-i0 @ 00:02:07
- Notes:
  - Helps avoid category errors in biology.

## CLM-0021: Consciousness can be treated as an operator on mental states that increases global coherence.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:26:51
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:27:12
- Notes:
  - This is a functional claim about what consciousness does in the architecture.

## CLM-0022: Coherence is a control-relevant property: it makes the system's subsystems agree enough to act as one agent rather than as competing local processes.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:27:12
  - ccc_37c3_12167_synthetic_sentience @ 00:11:15
- Notes:
  - Often expressed with the "conductor" metaphor.

## CLM-0023: The self is a virtual construct (a model of being a person) that supports control, explanation, and coordination.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_CcQMYNi9a2w @ 01:59:34
  - ccc_38c3_self_models_of_loving_grace @ 00:01:14
- Notes:
  - Phrase carefully: "fiction/virtual" in the technical sense of a representational construct.

## CLM-0024: A narrative self is often a post-hoc explanatory artifact; it can be coherent without being a faithful causal story.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:32:21
- Notes:
  - This supports a consistent distinction between control explanations and introspective narratives.

## CLM-0025: Minimal consciousness can be framed as perception of perception; higher-order awareness can include explicit awareness of self and even deconstruction of the observer model.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:16:38
  - ccc_37c3_12167_synthetic_sentience @ 00:40:15
- Notes:
  - Phrase carefully: the ordering is a pedagogical device, not a formal theory of levels.

## CLM-0026: Computationalist functionalism is an epistemological stance: objects are constructed from observations and defined by the functional differences their presence makes in how the world evolves.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:08:24
- Notes:
  - This is about how we construct objects/knowledge, not the slogan "today's computers think."

## CLM-0027: Strong computationalism takes implementable representational languages to have bounded expressive power (Church-Turing), and treats "hypercomputational objects" as non-referenceable for realizable systems.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - ccc_37c3_12167_synthetic_sentience @ 00:08:58
- Notes:
  - "Bounded expressive power" here is about realizable systems/languages, not a claim that all computation is simple.

## CLM-0028: The experienced world is a generated model ("a dream of reality"); the self is a character inside that model rather than a physics-level entity.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:04:02
  - yt_CcQMYNi9a2w @ 01:59:34
  - yt_HTCRIX3P32M @ 00:00:02
- Notes:
  - The point is representationalism (model vs territory), not mysticism.

## CLM-0029: Consciousness can be described as a coherence-maintaining control process that monitors disharmonies among subsystems and coordinates them (the "conductor of a mental orchestra" metaphor).
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:19:16
  - ccc_38c3_self_models_of_loving_grace @ 00:10:34
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:41:09
- Notes:
  - This frames consciousness by function: what it does in the architecture.

## CLM-0030: Consciousness is a reflexive second-order perception that creates a bubble of "nowness" (the subjective present) as a stabilized model state.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:19:16
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:30:34
  - yt_y0txHUVZF5I @ 00:00:18
- Notes:
  - "Nowness" is a modeled present, not a metaphysical property of time.

## CLM-0031: Consciousness can be framed as a real-time control model of attention (attention schema): it tracks what the system attends to and supports global regulation/coherence.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_UkAOHrbcnAs @ 00:19:13
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:41:09
  - ccc_38c3_self_models_of_loving_grace @ 00:10:40
- Notes:
  - This is presented as convergent with (and partly inspired by) attention schema theory.

## CLM-0032: Conscious suffering is interpreted as dysregulation: a failure of the mind to maintain coherent regulation; "more consciousness" corresponds to building better models for regulation.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:45:15
- Notes:
  - This is a functional framing of suffering as a control/constraint-violation phenomenon.

## CLM-0033: The "conductor/coherence" framing is presented as convergent with multiple consciousness theories (e.g., global workspace, Cartesian theater, attention schema) rather than as a unique doctrine.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:19:16
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:41:09
- Notes:
  - Treat as a bibliographic/navigation claim: he points to multiple traditions.

## CLM-0034: Free will is framed as the ability to do what one believes is right; it is not opposed to determinism or coercion. Its opposite is compulsion (acting despite knowing better).
- Status: verified
- Confidence: high
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:36:40
- Notes:
  - This reframes free-will debates as category errors about control architectures.

## CLM-0035: LLMs can simulate aspects of a conscious interaction partner (including self-report) when prompted, without being required to maintain an underlying coherent first-person simulation to produce outputs.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:25:22
- Notes:
  - This is about functional requirements: what the system must implement to output the behavior.

## CLM-0036: Some "agentic" behavior attributed to LLMs can be understood as a simulated agent: the simulation can act as a stand-in for agency even if the underlying driver is next-token prediction.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_3MkJEGE9GRY @ 01:06:10
- Notes:
  - The claim is not "LLMs have no agency," but that agency can be simulated as a layer.

## CLM-0037: Typical software runs on a substrate engineered to be highly deterministic and is forced to follow the algorithm; this differs from biological self-organization and matters for machine-consciousness conjectures.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_3MkJEGE9GRY @ 00:57:15
- Notes:
  - This motivates why "same performance" need not imply "same internal organization."

## CLM-0038: A system can be conscious without a first-person perspective; consciousness is often experienced at the interface between self-model and world-model but can occur in dreams and other states.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_xthJ1R9Ifc0 @ 00:08:46
- Notes:
  - This distinguishes "consciousness" from "first-person perspective" as separate representational conditions.

## CLM-0039: Valence is what gives meaning and color to perception; it depends on preferences and works alongside norms to shape control objectives.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:27:50
- Notes:
  - This is a bridge between perception (model constraints) and control (what matters).

## CLM-0040: The meaning of internal signals (pain/pleasure) is not imposed by physics; it is generated by the mind's interpretation and valuation.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:56:55
- Notes:
  - This is consistent with the "dream/model" framing: meaning is a modeled property.

## CLM-0041: Pleasure can be interpreted as moving a feedback loop closer to a target value; pain corresponds to being off-target and noticing the error signal.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:59:20
- Notes:
  - This treats hedonic tone as a control-theoretic signal rather than a primitive metaphysical quality.

## CLM-0042: Reward hacking or self-modification is a generic risk for sufficiently capable agents; even humans can learn to modify their own reward function.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:38:16
- Notes:
  - This motivates caution around "alignment by fixed reward."

## CLM-0043: Social systems have reward infrastructures (e.g., money/finance) that regulate resource allocation; misaligned incentives can dominate behavior at scale.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:50:31
- Notes:
  - Used as a cautionary analogy for AI governance and institutional design.

## CLM-0044: Norms can be described as beliefs "without priors": desired truths that constrain behavior beyond immediate pleasure/pain, enabling coordination.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:27:50
- Notes:
  - The phrasing is rhetorically sharp; treat it as a functional characterization.

## CLM-0045: The first-person perspective is a representational content; it is not strictly required for consciousness in all states.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_xthJ1R9Ifc0 @ 00:08:46
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:41:09
- Notes:
  - This is a key disambiguation for the "consciousness vs self" chapters.

## CLM-0046: "Enlightenment" can be described as recognizing that the self/observer is a representation and being able to deconstruct that representational stance (rather than as moral purity).
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:15:15
- Notes:
  - Use this as a model-level framing: enlightenment is a representational insight about the self-model, not an ethical badge.

## CLM-0047: For machine consciousness, what may be missing in current AI is "the dream within the dream": a model of the act of perceiving (second-order perception / observer construction), not just high-resolution generated content.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: low
- Supports:
  - yt_O5hymlaldf0 @ 00:01:58
- Notes:
  - This connects the "generated dreams" metaphor to the observer/second-order-perception framing.

## CLM-0048: A desirable outcome for AI is to extend human agency (and potentially consciousness) onto new substrates, rather than building "silicon golems" that dominate and control humans.
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_4kZE479isH8 @ 00:52:19
- Notes:
  - Keep this as a design/policy framing: capability is not destiny; architecture and incentives matter.

## CLM-0049: A hopeful social trajectory is "universal basic intelligence": each person has access to personal AI that increases competence and can be understood as extending the user's cognitive agency (rather than merely providing income).
- Status: verified
- Confidence: medium
- Supports:
  - yt_oR-BQTSpL5U @ 00:50:27
- Notes:
  - Phrase carefully: "extending consciousness into AI" is his rhetoric; interpret in the book as extending agency via shared modeling/control loops.
