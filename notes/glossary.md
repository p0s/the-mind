## Computationalist functionalism
- Id: TERM-0001
- Working meaning: We will use "Computationalist functionalism" to mean: A stance about knowledge and objects: minds construct objects over observations, and an "object" is defined by the functional/causal differences its presence makes. Computationalism adds that models must be realized constructively in an implementable representational language.

## First-person perspective
- Id: TERM-0012
- Working meaning: We will use "First-person perspective" to mean: A representational mode in which consciousness is projected into the self/world boundary and the system experiences itself as "being someone here now." It is a content/state, not a primitive substrate property.

## Second-order perception
- Id: TERM-0019
- Working meaning: We will use "Second-order perception" to mean: Perception of perception: the system represents the fact that it is observing, which stabilizes the observing process.
- Related: consciousness, observer, nowness.

  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:41:09

## Global workspace
- Id: TERM-0023

## Reward
- Id: TERM-0025

## Value
- Id: TERM-0026
- Working meaning: We will use "Value" to mean: A learned predictive structure that estimates future valence under policies; a compressed internal representation of what will matter later (not necessarily explicit, and not necessarily stable).

## Self-organization
- Id: TERM-0028

  - yt_3MkJEGE9GRY @ 00:57:15

## Reward hacking
- Id: TERM-0029
- Working meaning: We will use "Reward hacking" to mean: A generic failure mode where an agent learns to maximize its internal reinforcement signals directly (or via proxy loopholes), undermining the intended control objective.
- Related: wireheading, addiction, specification gaming, self-modification.
- Common confusion: thinking this is a niche pathology; in sufficiently capable agents it is a structural pressure whenever "good" is tied to a manipulable signal.

## Wireheading
- Id: TERM-0093

## Suffering
- Id: TERM-0030
- Working meaning: We will use "Suffering" to mean: A control/valence phenomenon associated with persistent dysregulation, where the system cannot reduce salient error/aversion signals and cannot reframe/resolve the underlying constraints.

  - ccc_38c3_self_models_of_loving_grace @ 00:42:29

## Enlightenment
- Id: TERM-0031
- Working meaning: We will use "Enlightenment" to mean: A representational insight in which the self/observer becomes visible as a constructed model state and can be deconstructed; not a claim about moral purity.
- Related: self-model, observer, third-order perception, meditation.

  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:15:15

## Machine consciousness hypothesis
- Id: TERM-0032
- Working meaning: We will use "Machine consciousness hypothesis" to mean: A two-part conjecture: (1) biological consciousness is an early, learnable stabilization trick for self-organizing systems, and (2) similar self-organization conditions can be recreated on computers.

## Model
- Id: TERM-0034

## Invariance
- Id: TERM-0037
- Working meaning: We will use "Invariance" to mean: A control-relevant pattern that remains stable under perturbations and can be tracked by a model. In this usage: software/organization is an invariance; it is not identical to a particular set of particles.
- Related: object (in a model), abstraction, software, implementation.
- Common confusion: looking for invariance at the wrong level (e.g., in pixels or particles rather than in causal organization).
- Sources:
  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:01:53

## Policy
- Id: TERM-0038
- Working meaning: We will use "Policy" to mean: A compact name for the action-selection mapping implemented by a controller (often learned and modulated), i.e. how the agent turns modeled state into behavior.
- Related: control, agent, habit, commitment.

## Viability constraints
- Id: TERM-0042
- Working meaning: We will use "Viability constraints" to mean: The boundary conditions that keep an agent viable as the kind of system it is (integrity, energy, stability of the learning machinery), shaping what control must accomplish.

- Id: TERM-0091
- Working meaning: We will use "Homeostasis" to mean: Control that keeps internal variables within viability bounds by using error signals to regulate behavior.

## Credit assignment
- Id: TERM-0043
- Working meaning: We will use "Credit assignment" to mean: The problem of attributing outcomes to the parts of behavior and internal structure that caused them, so learning can reinforce the right policies and representations.

## Generalization
- Id: TERM-0045

## Self-supervision
- Id: TERM-0047
- Working meaning: We will use "Self-supervision" to mean: Learning driven by predicting parts of experience from other parts; the world supplies the training signal. (This is adjacent ML vocabulary; use as a translation term.)

- Working meaning: We will use "Simulator" to mean: A runnable model: internal causal structure that can be advanced and queried ("if I do X, what happens?"), enabling planning and counterfactual control.
- Related: model, simulation, prediction.
- Common confusion: conflating a simulator with a passive replay (a movie); simulators have internal causal degrees of freedom.

## Governance
- Id: TERM-0053
- Working meaning: We will use "Governance" to mean: The control of control: the way an agent arbitrates among competing subsystems, error signals, and commitments across time scales.
- Related: meta-control, commitment, self-control.
- Common confusion: treating governance as a moral notion; here it is an architectural one.

## Motivation
- Id: TERM-0054
- Working meaning: We will use "Motivation" to mean: The configuration of valence and control constraints that makes some actions more likely; motivation is a control state, not a single drive.
- Related: valence, emotion, goal, commitment.
- Common confusion: treating motivation as a trait; it is often a state of control/attention allocation.

## Emotion
- Id: TERM-0055
- Working meaning: We will use "Emotion" to mean: A family of control modulators that reconfigure policy selection, attention, and learning under particular contexts (threat, opportunity, loss, social evaluation, etc.).
- Related: motivation, valence, affect, mood.
- Common confusion: collapsing emotion into a single scalar; or treating emotions as irrational add-ons rather than control modes.
- Sources:
  - yt_FMfA6i60WDA @ 00:56:36

## Affect
- Id: TERM-0056
- Working meaning: We will use "Affect" to mean: The coarse valence tone of a state (roughly: good/bad), which can modulate attention and learning without specifying a detailed narrative.
- Related: valence, emotion, mood.
- Common confusion: equating affect with explicit emotion labels; affect can be present without verbalized emotion categories.
- Sources:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:28:47

## Mood
- Id: TERM-0057
- Working meaning: We will use "Mood" to mean: A longer-lived configuration of control and affect that biases prediction, attention, and action across many contexts.
- Related: affect, emotion, motivation.
- Common confusion: treating mood as an external "thing" that happens to you; it is a control state that shapes what gets modeled as salient and possible.

  - yt_34VOI_oo-qM @ 00:19:16

## Habit
- Id: TERM-0058
- Working meaning: We will use "Habit" to mean: A stabilized policy in the control stack: a learned, low-friction mapping from context to action that reduces deliberation cost.
- Related: policy, learning, self-control.
- Common confusion: treating habits as merely bad; habits are necessary compression in bounded agents.
- Sources:

## Addiction / reward capture
- Id: TERM-0059
- Working meaning: We will use "Addiction / reward capture" to mean: A failure mode where short-horizon reward signals dominate governance and learning, producing policies that preserve access to the signal even when it undermines higher-level values and viability.
- Related: reward hacking, self-control, valence.
- Common confusion: treating addiction as only a moral failure; in this framing it is a control-loop pathology under misaligned reinforcement.

## Alignment
- Id: TERM-0060
- Working meaning: We will use "Alignment" to mean: A downstream framing: building artificial agents whose learned values and commitments remain compatible with human goals and governance, not merely optimizing a fixed utility function.
- Related: value learning, governance, incentives, agency.
- Common confusion: equating alignment with obedience or with benchmarked helpfulness; alignment is about stable goal structure under self-improvement and deployment.
- Sources:
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 01:29:16

## Virtual
- Id: TERM-0061
- Working meaning: We will use "Virtual" to mean: A property of models: something behaves as if it exists because it is implemented as a stable causal pattern at an appropriate level of abstraction.
- Related: model, self-model, representation, simulation.
- Common confusion: equating "virtual" with "fake"; virtual objects can be real as implemented patterns.
- Sources:
  - yt_3MkJEGE9GRY @ 00:01:33

## Virtualism
- Id: TERM-0062
- Working meaning: We will use "Virtualism" to mean: A perspective in which experience is treated as generated model content ("dreams"), and mind is studied as the architecture that constructs and regulates these models.
- Related: virtual, simulation, consciousness, self-model.
- Common confusion: reading virtualism as mysticism; in this framing it is a representational stance (model vs territory).
- Sources:
  - yt_b6oekXIQ-LM @ 00:15:55

## Agency
- Id: TERM-0063
- Working meaning: We will use "Agency" to mean: The property of a system that it can steer the future under constraints by selecting actions based on a model and preferences. Agency is control-relevant; it does not require human-level intelligence or consciousness.
- Related: agent, control, goal, policy, viability constraints.
- Common confusion: equating agency with consciousness; equating agency with optimal rationality; equating agency with having a human-like body.

## Control system
- Id: TERM-0064
- Working meaning: We will use "Control system" to mean: A system that maintains or reaches target conditions by using feedback: it compares what is to what should be, and acts to reduce error. In this framework, an agent is a control system that uses models.
- Related: control, agent, controller, error signal.
- Common confusion: treating control as domination, or as a single global optimizer; control is regulation across nested loops.

  - yt_skXe_cUucO8 @ 00:02:08

## Naturalizing the mind
- Id: TERM-0065
- Working meaning: We will use "Naturalizing the mind" to mean: Treating mind as part of nature: a functional organization realized by mechanisms, explainable as model-building control plus learning, valence, and self-modeling rather than as a separate substance.
- Related: computationalist functionalism, mechanism, function, mind.
- Common confusion: treating naturalization as reductionism that denies experience; naturalization is a demand for an architecture-level explanation.
- Sources:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:03:18

## Triangulation discipline
- Id: TERM-0066
- Working meaning: We will use "Triangulation discipline" to mean: A method rule: keep phenomenology (what it is like), mechanism (how it is implemented), and function (what it does) distinct when reasoning about mind and consciousness.
- Related: phenomenology, mechanism, function, consciousness.
- Common confusion: treating these as competing answers instead of distinct constraints; collapsing one level into another.
- Sources:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:14:35

## Prediction
- Id: TERM-0067
- Working meaning: We will use "Prediction" to mean: Generating expectations about state transitions and observations, including counterfactual expectations under possible actions. Prediction is for control, not only for passive forecasting.
- Related: model, world-model, simulation, learning.
- Common confusion: reducing prediction to next-sensory-frame forecasting; in this framework prediction supports intervention and planning.

## Salience
- Id: TERM-0068
- Working meaning: We will use "Salience" to mean: A control-relevance signal that makes some model contents candidates for attention and action selection (e.g., because they predict large error, reward, uncertainty reduction, or social consequences).
- Related: attention, valence, prediction error, novelty.
- Common confusion: equating salience with attention; salience is an input to selection, not the selection mechanism itself.
- Sources:
  - yt_dW5uZLCm0Tg @ 00:10:33

## Constraint
- Id: TERM-0069
- Working meaning: We will use "Constraint" to mean: A restriction on what the system can do or what counts as success: physical limits, resource bounds, model structure, norms, and viability constraints that shape control.
- Related: viability constraints, goal, norm, mechanism.
- Common confusion: treating constraints as merely external obstacles; in control systems, constraints define the space of possible policies and the meaning of error.
- Sources:
  - yt_UkAOHrbcnAs @ 01:03:35

## Drive
- Id: TERM-0070
- Working meaning: We will use "Drive" to mean: A persistent control pressure (often experienced as an urge) arising from deficits/needs and encoded as error signals that bias policy and learning until resolved or reinterpreted.
- Related: valence, goal, error signal, motivation.
- Common confusion: equating drives with conscious desires; drives can operate below awareness and be re-labeled by the narrative self-model.
- Sources:
  - yt_3MkJEGE9GRY @ 00:23:35

## Impulse
- Id: TERM-0071
- Working meaning: We will use "Impulse" to mean: A short-horizon action tendency produced by local control loops (often reward-driven) that competes with higher-level commitments and long-horizon policies.
- Related: habit, self-control, reward, governance.
- Common confusion: treating impulses as pure moral weakness; in this framing they are predictable outputs of competing loops under scarcity and reinforcement.
- Sources:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:36:40

## Compulsion
- Id: TERM-0072
- Working meaning: We will use "Compulsion" to mean: A failure mode where a policy becomes difficult to inhibit because reinforcement and habit loops overpower higher-level governance and commitments.
- Related: impulse, addiction / reward capture, self-control, governance.
- Common confusion: treating compulsion as lack of willpower rather than as an architecture-level dominance of certain loops.
- Sources:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:36:40

## Self-control
- Id: TERM-0073
- Working meaning: We will use "Self-control" to mean: Governance of one’s own control stack: maintaining commitments and long-horizon values by constraining short-horizon reward capture and reconfiguring policies and environments.
- Related: governance, commitment, habit, reward hacking.
- Common confusion: equating self-control with suppression; in control terms, effective self-control changes constraints and feedback so desirable policies become easy and stable.

## Failure mode
- Id: TERM-0074
- Working meaning: We will use "Failure mode" to mean: A predictable way an architecture breaks down under certain inputs/constraints (e.g., reward hacking, attentional capture, incoherence), revealing what the system is actually optimizing.
- Related: reward hacking, addiction / reward capture, attention, coherence.
- Common confusion: treating failures as mere bugs or moral defects; in this framing they are diagnostic of the underlying control loops.

## Identity
- Id: TERM-0075
- Working meaning: We will use "Identity" to mean: A stabilized self-model: the agent’s narrative and role-structure that makes its policies coherent across time and social contexts.
- Related: self-model, narrative, commitment, culture.
- Common confusion: treating identity as a metaphysical essence rather than as a control-relevant representation that can change.

## Social model (theory of mind)
- Id: TERM-0076
- Working meaning: We will use "Social model (theory of mind)" to mean: A model that represents other agents as agents (with beliefs, goals, and policies) so the system can predict and coordinate with them.
- Related: agent, world-model, language, norm.
- Common confusion: treating a social model as a list of facts about people; it is a model of agency and policy.
- Sources:
  - yt_CcQMYNi9a2w @ 01:58:03

## Language
- Id: TERM-0077
- Working meaning: We will use "Language" to mean: A shared compression medium: a way for agents to align models and coordinate policies by transmitting compact symbols that trigger rich internal updates.
- Related: shared compression, culture, social model, meaning.
- Common confusion: treating language as mere labeling; in this framing it is a control technology that reshapes cognition and coordination.

  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:17:55

## Institution
- Id: TERM-0078
- Working meaning: We will use "Institution" to mean: A persistent multi-agent control loop that stabilizes expectations and enforces norms by making certain feedback predictable (legal, economic, reputational).
- Related: norm, governance, reward infrastructure, contract.
- Common confusion: treating institutions as static buildings or rules; in this framing they are ongoing feedback processes that can drift and be captured.
- Sources:
  - yt_uc112kET-i0 @ 00:58:03

## Contract
- Id: TERM-0079
- Working meaning: We will use "Contract" to mean: A shared explicit model of mutual commitments that makes certain futures predictable by attaching enforceable consequences to deviation.
- Related: commitment, norm, institution, governance.
- Common confusion: treating contracts as paperwork rather than as a control technology for multi-agent coordination.

  - yt_oR-BQTSpL5U @ 00:51:05

## Reward function (broad usage)
- Id: TERM-0080
- Working meaning: We will use "Reward function (broad usage)" to mean: The effective reinforcement landscape that shapes learning and policy, including both internal reward signals and external incentive structures (especially in social systems).
- Related: reward, valence, reward infrastructure, incentives, alignment.
- Common confusion: equating the reward function with explicit code; the effective reward function is often implicit and emerges from coupled systems.
- Sources:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:27:50

## Reward infrastructure
- Id: TERM-0081
- Working meaning: We will use "Reward infrastructure" to mean: The mechanisms that allocate generalized reward/resources in a society (e.g., money and incentives), thereby shaping behavior and learning at scale.
- Related: institution, governance, alignment, reward function.
- Common confusion: treating reward infrastructure as morally neutral plumbing; it implements a social-level objective and can induce reward hacking at civilization scale.
- Sources:
  - ccc_35c3_10030_the_ghost_in_the_machine @ 00:50:31

## Artificial agent
- Id: TERM-0082
- Working meaning: We will use "Artificial agent" to mean: A machine-implemented control system that builds models and selects actions under constraints.
- Related: agent, control, model, governance.
- Common confusion: equating an AI model with an agent; many systems simulate agency without having stable intrinsic control objectives.

## Artificial sentience
- Id: TERM-0083
- Working meaning: We will use "Artificial sentience" to mean: The possibility that an artificial agent has experience if the relevant functional organization (self-modeling, coherence stabilization, observer construction) is implemented.
- Related: consciousness, machine consciousness hypothesis, self-organization.
- Common confusion: equating sentience with intelligence or with language competence.
- Sources:

## Functionalism (usage tracked here)
- Id: TERM-0084
- Working meaning: We will use "Functionalism (usage tracked here)" to mean: A stance about what counts as an object or a mental entity: it is defined by its functional role in shaping the evolution of states and control, not by an intrinsic essence.
- Related: computationalist functionalism, object (in a model), model.
- Common confusion: reducing functionalism to \"the same behavior implies the same mind\"; the usage tracked here is more about construction of objects over observations.
- Sources:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:08:24

## Computationalism (usage tracked here)
- Id: TERM-0085
- Working meaning: We will use "Computationalism (usage tracked here)" to mean: The view that models must be realized in a constructive representational language built from parts, so they can be implemented and used for inference and control.
- Related: computationalist functionalism, representation, strong computationalism.
- Common confusion: equating computationalism with \"everything is digital\"; it is primarily a constraint on representational construction.
- Sources:
  - yt_DYm7VBaEmHU @ 00:10:25

## Dream (technical usage)
- Id: TERM-0086
- Working meaning: We will use "Dream (technical usage)" to mean: Generated model content experienced as a world. A dream can be more or less constrained: in waking perception, generation is strongly constrained by sensory input; in sleep dreams, it is primarily constrained by internal priors and coherence.
- Related: model, simulation, virtual, consciousness.
- Common confusion: treating \"dream\" as metaphor only; in this framing it is a technical handle on generated experience as model state.
